, 2018. Whenever flue gas mercury control wastewater is used in any other plant process or is sent to a treatment system at the plant, the resulting effluent must comply with the discharge standard in this paragraph.
            (i) Gasification wastewater. For any electric generating unit with a total nameplate generating capacity of more than 50 megawatts and that is not an oil-fired unit, the quantity of pollutants in gasification wastewater shall not exceed the quantity determined by multiplying the flow of gasification wastewater times the concentration listed in the table following this paragraph (i). Dischargers must meet the standards in this paragraph by November 1, 2018. These standards apply to the discharge of gasification wastewater generated on and after November 1, 2018.

            (a) 1982 PSNS. Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7, any new source as of October 14, 1980, subject to paragraph (a) of this section, which introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works, must comply with 40 CFR part 403, the following pretreatment standards for new sources, and the PSES in § 423.16, established on November 3, 2015. In the case of conflict, the more stringent standards apply:
            (1) PCBs. There shall be no discharge of polychlorinated biphenyl compounds such as those used for transformer fluid.
            (2) Chemical metal cleaning wastes. The pollutants discharged in chemical metal cleaning wastes shall not exceed the concentration listed in the following table:

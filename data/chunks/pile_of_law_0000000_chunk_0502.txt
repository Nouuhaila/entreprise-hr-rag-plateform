            Subpart C—Soap Manufacturing by Fatty Acid Neutralization Subcategory
            
              § 417.30
              Applicability; description of the soap manufacturing by fatty acid neutralization subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the manufacturing of neat soap by neutralizing refined fatty acids with an alkaline material in approximately stoichiemetric amounts in batch or continuous operations.

              (a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations and methods of analysis set forth in 40 CFR part 401 shall apply to this subpart.
              (b) The term anhydrous product shall mean the theoretical product that would result if all water were removed from the actual product.
              (c) The term neat soap shall mean the solution of completely saponified and purified soap containing about 20-30 percent water which is ready for final formulation into a finished product.

this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best conventional pollutant control technology (BCT): The limitations shall be the same as those specified for conventional pollutants (which are defined in § 401.16) in § 405.92 of this subpart for the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT).

            Subpart J—Dry Milk Subcategory
            
              § 405.100
              Applicability; description of the dry milk subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the manufacture of dry whole milk, dry skim milk and dry buttermilk.
            
            
              § 405.101
              Specialized definitions.
              For the purpose of this subpart:
              (a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations and methods of analysis set forth in part 401 of this chapter shall apply to this subpart.
              (b) The term “BOD5 input” shall mean the biochemical oxygen demand of the materials entered into process. It can be calculated by multiplying the fats, proteins and carbohydrates by factors of 0.890, 1.031 and 0.691 respectively. Organic acids (e.g., lactic acids) should be included as carbohydrates. Composition of input materials may be based on either direct analysis or generally accepted published values.
            
            
              § 405.102
              Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.
              Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

              (a) For milk drying plants with an input equivalent to more than 145,000 lb/day of milk equivalent (more than 15,070 lb/day of BOD5 input).

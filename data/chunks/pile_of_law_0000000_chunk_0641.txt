              (2) Example Application of Effluent Limitations Guidelines as Applicable to Phenolic Compounds, Hexavalent Chromium, and Total Chromium.
              The following example presents the derivation of a BAT phenolic compound (4AAP) effluent limitation (30-day average) for a petroleum refinery permit. The methodology is also applicable to hexavalent chromium and total chromium.

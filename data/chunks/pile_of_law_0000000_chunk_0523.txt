            Subpart J—Air—SO3 Sulfation and Sulfonation Subcategory
            
              § 417.100
              Applicability; description of the air—SO3 sulfation and sulfonation subcategory.

              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the manufacture of sulfonic acids and sulfuric acid esters by means of sulfation and sulfonation employing air and sulfur trioxide (SO3), in either continuous or batch processes.
            
            
              § 417.101

              For the purpose of this subpart:
              (a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations and methods of analysis set forth in 40 CFR part 401 shall apply to this subpart.
              (b) The term anhydrous product shall mean the theoretical product that would result if all water were removed from the actual product.
              (c) The term surfactant shall mean those methylene blue active substances amenable to measurement by the method described in “Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes,” 1971, Environmental Protection Agency, Analytical Quality Control Laboratory, page 131.

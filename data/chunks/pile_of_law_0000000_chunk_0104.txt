              Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best conventional pollutant control technology (BCT): The limitations shall be the same as those specified for conventional pollutants (which are defined in § 401.16) in § 405.72 of this subpart for the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT).

              § 405.80
              Applicability; description of the ice cream, frozen desserts, novelties and other dairy desserts subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the manufacture of ice cream, ice milk, sherbert, water ices, stick confections, frozen novelties products, frozen desserts, melorine, pudding and other dairy product base desserts. If fluid mixes prepared at another plant are employed, the appropriate values from subpart G should be deducted from the limitations.

              (a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations and methods of analysis set forth in part 401 of this chapter, shall apply to this subpart.
              (b) The term “BOD5 input” shall mean the biochemical oxygen demand of the materials entered into process. It can be calculated by multiplying the fats, proteins and carbohydrates by factors of 0.890, 1.031 and 0.691 respectively. Organic acids (e.g., lactic acids) should be included as carbohydrates. Composition of input materials may be based on either direct analyses or generally accepted published values.

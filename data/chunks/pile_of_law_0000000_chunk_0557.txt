            Subpart R—Manufacture of Drum Dried Detergents Subcategory
            
              § 417.180
              Applicability; description of the manufacture of drum dried detergents subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the operations associated with the manufacture of detergents by drum drying, including, but not limited to, drying of formulations on heated drums or rollers, conversion of dried detergents to powders or flakes, and packaging of finished products.
            
            
              § 417.181
              Specialized definitions.
              For the purpose of this subpart:
              (a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations and methods of analysis set forth in 40 CFR part 401 shall apply to this subpart.
              (b) The term anhydrous product shall mean the theoretical product that would result if all water were removed from the actual product.
              (c) The term surfactant shall mean those methylene blue active substances amenable to measurement by the method described in “Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes,” 1971, Environmental Protection Agency, Analytical Quality Control Laboratory, page 131.
              (d) The term BOD7 shall mean the biochemical oxygen demand as determined by incubation at 20 degrees C for a period of 7 days using an acclimated seed. Agitation employing a magnetic stirrer set at 200 to 500 r.p.m. may be used.

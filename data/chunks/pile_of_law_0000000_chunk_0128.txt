              Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable.
              The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart after application of the best available technology economically achievable: there shall be no discharge of process waste water pollutants to navigable waters.

facility operated separately or in combination with a water recirculation system designed, constructed and operated to maintain a surge capacity equal to the runoff from the 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event may be discharged, after treatment to the standards set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, whenever chronic or catastrophic precipitation events cause the water level to rise into the surge capacity. Process wastewater must be treated and discharged whenever the water level equals or exceeds the midpoint of the surge capacity.
              (c) The concentration of pollutants discharged in process wastewater pursuant to the limitations of paragraph (b) shall not exceed the values listed in the following table:

                  Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—

              The total suspended solid limitation set forth in this paragraph shall be waived for process wastewater from a calcium sulfate storage pile runoff facility, operated separately or in combination with a water recirculation system, which is chemically treated and then clarified or settled to meet the other pollutant limitations set forth in this paragraph.
              (d) The concentration of pollutants discharged in contaminated non-process wastewater shall not exceed the values listed in the following table:
              
                
                  Effluent characteristic
                  Effluent limitations (mg/l)
                  Maximum for any 1 day
                  Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—

              The pretreatment standards under section 307(c) of the Act for a source within the phosphate subcategory, which is a user of a publicly owned treatment works (and which would be a new source subject to section 306 of the Act, if it were to discharge pollutants to the navigable waters), shall be the standard set forth in 40 CFR part 128, except that, for the purpose of this section, 40 CFR 128.133 shall be amended to read as follows:
              
              
                In addition to the prohibitions set forth in 40 CFR 128.131, the pretreatment standard for incompatible pollutants introduced into a publicly owned treatment works shall be as follows: There shall be no discharge of process waste water pollutants.

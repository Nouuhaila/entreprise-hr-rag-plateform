              § 424.62
              Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.
              Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):
              (a) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart producing electrolytic manganese after application of the best practicable control technology currently available:

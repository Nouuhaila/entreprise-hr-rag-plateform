              Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.
              Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):
              (a) The following limitations constitute the maximum permissible discharge for urea manufacturing operations in which urea is produced as a solution product:
              
                
                  Effluent characteristics
                  Effluent limitations (mg/l)
                  Maximum for any 1 day
                  Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—

              (b) The following limitations constitute the maximum permissible discharge for urea manufacturing operations in which urea is prilled or granulated:
              
              
                
                  Effluent characteristics
                  Effluent limitations (mg/l)
                  Maximum for any 1 day
                  Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—

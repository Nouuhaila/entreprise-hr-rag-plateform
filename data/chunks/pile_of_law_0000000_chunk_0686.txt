              Pretreatment standards compliance dates.
              Compliance with the pretreatment standards for 2,3,7,8-TCDF for existing sources set forth in § 420.25(a) is required not later than October 17, 2005 whether or not the pretreatment authority issues or amends a pretreatment permit requiring such compliance.

              § 420.29
              Point of compliance monitoring.
              (a) Sintering direct dischargers. Pursuant to 40 CFR 122.44(i) and 122.45(h), a direct discharger must demonstrate compliance with the effluent limitations and standards for 2,3,7,8-TCDF at the point after treatment of sinter plant wastewater separately or in combination with blast furnace wastewater, but prior to mixing with process wastewaters from processes other than sintering and ironmaking, non-process wastewaters or non-contact cooling water, if such water(s) are in an amount greater than 5 percent by volume of the sintering process wastewaters.
              (b) Sintering indirect dischargers. An indirect discharger must demonstrate compliance with the pretreatment standards for 2,3,7,8-TCDF by monitoring at the point after treatment of sinter plant wastewater separately or in combination with blast furnace wastewater, but prior to mixing with process wastewaters from processes other than sintering and ironmaking, non-process wastewaters and non-contact cooling water in an amount greater than 5 percent by volume of the sintering process wastewaters.

            Subpart C—Ironmaking Subcategory
            
              § 420.30
              Applicability; description of the ironmaking subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges and to the introduction of pollutants into publicly owned treatment works resulting from ironmaking operations in which iron ore is reduced to molten iron in a blast furnace.
            
            
              § 420.31
              Specialized definitions.
              (a) For ironmaking blast furnaces, the term product means the amount of molten iron produced.
              (b) The term molten iron means iron produced in a blast furnace as measured at the blast furnace, and may include relatively minor amounts of blast furnace slag that may be skimmed from the molten iron at the steelmaking shop or other location remote from the blast furnace.
              (c) The term iron blast furnace means all blast furnaces except ferromanganese blast furnaces.
              (d) The term existing indirect dischargers means only those two iron blast furnace operations with discharges to publicly owned treatment works prior to May 27, 1982.

              § 420.32
              Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT).
              Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent

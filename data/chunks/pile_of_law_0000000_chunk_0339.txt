trial users of POTWs shall submit a toxic organic management plan that specifies to the control authority's satisfaction the toxic organic compounds used; the method of disposal used instead of dumping, such as reclamation, contract hauling, or incineration; and procedures for assuring that toxic organics do not routinely spill or leak into the wastewater.
              (c) If monitoring is necessary to measure compliance with the TTO standard the industrial user need analyze only for those pollutants which would reasonably be expected to be present.

              Standards for integrated facilities.
              Pretreatment standards for integrated facilities shall be computed as required by § 403.6(e) of EPA's General Pretreatment Regulations. In cases where electroplating process wastewaters are combined with regulated wastewaters which have 30 days average standards, the corresponding 30 day average standard for the electroplating wastewaters must be used. The 30 day average shall be determined for pollutants in the relevant subcategory from the corresponding daily and 4 day average values listed in the table below.

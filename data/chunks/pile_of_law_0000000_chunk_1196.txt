intain a surge capacity equal to the runoff from the 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event may be discharged, after treatment to the standards set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, whenever chronic or catastrophic precipitation events cause the water level in the pond to rise into the surge capacity. Process waste water must be treated and discharged whenever the water level equals or exceeds the mid-point of the surge capacity.
              (c) The concentration of pollutants discharged in process waste water pursuant to the limitations of paragraph (b) of this section shall not exceed the values listed in the following table:
              
                [Milligrams per liter]
                
                  Effluent characteristic
                  Effluent limitations
                  Maximum for any 1 day
                  Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—
                
                
                  TSS

              The total suspended solid limitation set forth in this paragraph shall be waived for process waste water from a calcium sulfate storage pile runoff facility, operated separately or in combination with a water recirculation system, which is chemically treated and then clarified or settled to meet the other pollutant limitations set forth in this paragraph.
              (d) The concentration of pollutants discharged in contaminated non-process waste water shall not exceed the values listed in the following table:
              
                [Milligrams per liter]
                
                  Effluent characteristic
                  Effluent limitations
                  Maximum for any 1 day
                  Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—

              Applicability; description of the defluorinated phosphoric acid subcategory.

              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the defluorination of phosphoric acid. Wet process phosphoric acid is dehydrated by application of heat and other processing acids such as vacuum and air stripping. The acid is concentrated up to 70-73% P2 O5 in the defluorination process.

              Specialized definitions.
              For the purpose of this subpart:
              (a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations, and methods of analysis set forth in 40 CFR part 401 shall apply to this subpart.
              (b) The term process waste water means any water which, during manufacturing or processing, comes into direct contact with or results from the production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished product, by-product, or waste product. The te

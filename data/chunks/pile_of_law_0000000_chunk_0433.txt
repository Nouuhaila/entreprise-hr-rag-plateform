ve the following new source performance standards (NSPS): There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants to navigable waters, except that unused bitterns may be returned to the body of water from which the process brine solution was originally withdrawn, provided no additional pollutants are added to the bitterns during the production of sodium chloride.
              (b) Any new source subject to this subpart and using the solution brine-mining process must achieve the following new source performance standards (NSPS): There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants to navigable waters.

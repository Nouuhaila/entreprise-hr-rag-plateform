                1 No detectable amount.
            
            (ii) At the permitting authority's discretion, instead of the monitoring in 40 CFR 122.11(b), compliance with the standards for the 126 priority pollutants in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section may be determined by engineering calculations which demonstrate that the regulated pollutants are not detectable in the final discharge by the analytical methods in 40 CFR part 136.
            (5) Fly ash transport water. There shall be no discharge of wastewater pollutants from fly ash transport water.
            (b) 2015 PSNS. Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7, any new source as of June 7, 2013, subject to this paragraph (b), which introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and the following pretreatment standards for new sources:
            (1) PCBs. There shall be no discharge of polychlorinated biphenyl compounds such as those used for transformer fluid.
            (2) Chemical metal cleaning wastes. The pollutants discharged in chemical metal cleaning wastes shall not exceed the concentration listed in the following table:
            
              
                Pollutant or pollutant property

            (3) [Reserved]
            (4)(i) Cooling tower blowdown. The pollutants discharged in cooling tower blowdown shall not exceed the concentration listed in the following table:
            
              
                Pollutant or pollutant property
                PSNS
                Maximum for any time(mg/L)
                
              
              
                The 126 priority pollutants (appendix A) contained in chemicals added for cooling tower maintenance, except:
                (1)
              
              
                Chromium, total

                1 No detectable amount.
            
            (ii) At the permitting authority's discretion, instead of the monitoring in 40 CFR 122.11(b), compliance with the standards for the 126 priority pollutants in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may be determined by engineering calculations which demonstrate that the regulated pollutants are not detectable in the final discharge by the analytical methods in 40 CFR part 136.
            (5) Fly ash transport water. There shall be no discharge of pollutants in fly ash transport water. Whenever fly ash transport water is used in any other plant process or is sent to a treatment system at the plant, the resulting effluent must comply with the discharge standard in this paragraph.

            Subpart A—Electroplating of Common Metals Subcategory
            
              § 413.10
              Applicability: Description of the electroplating of common metals subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart apply to dischargers of pollutants in process wastewaters resulting from the process in which a ferrous or nonferrous basis material is electroplated with copper, nickel, chromium, zinc, tin, lead, cadmium, iron, aluminum, or any combination thereof.
            
            
              § 413.11
              Specialized definitions.
              For the purpose of this subpart:
              (a) The term sq m [“sq ft”] shall mean the area plated expressed in square meters [square feet].
              (b) The term operation shall mean any step in the electroplating process in which a metal is electrodeposited on a basis material and which is followed by a rinse; this includes the related operations of alkaline cleaning, acid pickle, stripping, and coloring when each operation is followed by a rinse.
            
            
              §§ 413.12-413.13

              Except as provided in §§ 403.7 and 403.13 of this title, any existing source subject to this subpart which introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and achieve the following pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES):
              (a) No user introducing wastewater pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works under the provisions of this subpart shall augment the use of process wastewater or otherwise dilute the wastewater as a partial or total substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with this standard.
              (b) For a source discharging less than 38,000 liters (10,000 gal.) per calendar day of electroplating process wastewater the following limitations shall apply:

              (1) Increased loadings, not to exceed 11 percent of the above limitations, are allowed for by-product coke plants which have wet desulfurization systems but only to the extent such systems generate an increased effluent volume.
              (2) Increased loadings, not to exceed 27 percent of the above limitations, are allowed for by-product coke plants which include indirect ammonia recovery systems but only to the extent that such systems generate an increased effluent volume.

              (a) Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):
              
                
                  Effluent characteristic

              Any existing source subject to this subpart that introduces process wastewater pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403. In addition, the following pretreatment standard establishes the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this section which may be discharged to a publicly owned treatment works by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart.

              Standards of performance for new sources.
              (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section the following standards of performance establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, which may be discharged by a new source subject to the provisions of this subpart:
              
                
                  Effluent characteristic

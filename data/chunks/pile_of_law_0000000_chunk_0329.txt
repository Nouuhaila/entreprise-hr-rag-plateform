mitations attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT).
              Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the application of BAT:
              (a) For CAFO production areas: the CAFO shall attain the same limitations and requirements as § 412.31(a).
              (b) For CAFO land application areas: the CAFO shall attain the same limitations and requirements as § 412.31(b).
            
            
              
              § 412.34
              [Reserved]
            
            
              § 412.35
              New source performance standards (NSPS).
              Any new point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the application of NSPS:
              (a) For CAFO production areas. The CAFO shall attain the same limitations and requirements as § 412.31(a)(1) and § 412.31(a)(2).
              (b) For CAFO land application areas: The CAFO shall attain the same limitations and requirements as § 412.31(b)(1) and § 412.31(b)(2).
              (c) The CAFO shall attain the limitations and requirements of this paragraph as of the date of permit coverage.
              (d) Any source subject to this subpart that commenced discharging after April 14, 1993, and prior to April 14, 2003, which was a new source subject to the standards specified in § 412.15, revised as of July 1, 2002, must continue to achieve those standards for the applicable time period specified in 40 CFR 122.29(d)(1). Thereafter, the source must achieve the standards specified in § 412.31(a) and (b).
            
            
              § 412.36
              [Reserved]
            
            
              § 412.37
              Additional measures.
              (a) Each CAFO subject to this subpart must implement the following requirements:
              (1) Visual inspections. There must be routine visual inspections of the CAFO production area. At a minimum, the following must be visually inspected:
              (i) Weekly inspections of all storm water diversion devices, runoff diversion structures, and devices channelling contaminated storm water to the wastewater and manure storage and containment structure;
              (ii) Daily inspection of water lines, including drinking water or cooling water lines;
              (iii) Weekly inspections of the manure, litter, and process wastewater impoundments; the inspection will note the level in liquid impoundments as indicated by the depth marker in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
              (2) Depth marker. All open surface liquid impoundments must have a depth marker which clearly indicates the minimum capacity necessary to contain the runoff and direct precipitation of the 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event. In the case of new sources subject to effluent limitations established pursuant to § 412.46(a)(1) of this part, all open surface manure storage structures associated with such sources must include a depth marker which clearly indicates the minimum capacity necessary to contain the maximum runoff and direct precipitation associated with the design storm used in sizing the impoundment for no discharge.
              (3) Corrective actions. Any deficiencies found as a result of these inspections must be corrected as soon as possible.
              (4) Mortality handling

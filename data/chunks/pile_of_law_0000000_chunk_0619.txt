              (b) The following standard is applied to the cooling tower discharge part of the total refinery flow to the POTW by multiplying: (1) The standard; (2) by the total refinery flow to the POTW; and (3) by the ratio of the cooling tower discharge flow to the total refinery flow.
              
                
                  Pollutant or pollutant property

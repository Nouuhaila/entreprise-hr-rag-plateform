ns of this subpart are applicable to process wastewater discharges resulting from facilities that primarily manufacture nonwoven textile products of wool, cotton, or synthetics, singly or as blends, by mechanical, thermal, and/or adhesive bonding procedures. Nonwoven products produced by fulling and felting processes are covered in subpart I—Felted Fabric Processing.

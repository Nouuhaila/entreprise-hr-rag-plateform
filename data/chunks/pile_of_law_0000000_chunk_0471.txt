              § 415.530
              Applicability; description of the silver nitrate production subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges and to the introduction of pollutants into publicly owned treatment works resulting from the production of silver nitrate.
            
            
              § 415.531
              Specialized definitions.
              For the purpose of this subpart:
              (a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations and methods of analysis set forth in part 401 of this chapter shall apply to this subpart.
              (b) The term product shall mean silver nitrate.
              (c) The term process wastewater means any water which, during manufacturing or processing, comes into direct contact with or results from the production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished product, by-product, or waste product. The term “process wastewater” does not include contaminated non-process wastewater, as defined below.
              (d) The term process wastewater pollutants means pollutants present in process wastewater.
              (e) The term contaminated non-process wastewater shall mean any water which, during manufacturing or processing, comes into incidental contact with any raw material, intermediate product, finished product, by-product or waste product by means of (1) rainfall runoff; (2) accidental spills; (3) accidental leaks caused by the failure of process equipment, which are repaired within the shortest reasonable time not to exceed 24 hours after discovery; and (4) discharges from safety showers and related personal safety equipment: Provided, That all reasonable measures have been taken (i) to prevent, reduce and control such contact to the maximum extent feasible; and (ii) to mitigate the effects of such contact once it has occurred.

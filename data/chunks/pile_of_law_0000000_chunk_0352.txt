              Pretreatment standards for existing sources.
              Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7 and 403.13, any existing source subject to this subpart which introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and achieve the following pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES):
              (a) No User introducing wastewater pollutants into publicly owned treatment works under the provisions of this subpart shall augment the use of process wastewater or otherwise dilute the wastewater as a partial or total substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with this standard.
              (b) For a source discharging less than 38,000 liters (10,000 gal.) per calendar day of electroplating process wastewater the following limitations shall apply:

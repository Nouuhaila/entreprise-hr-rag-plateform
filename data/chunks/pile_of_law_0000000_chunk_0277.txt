              (b) Any cane sugar factory employing waste stabilization where all or a portion of the waste water discharge is stored for the entire grinding season shall meet the following limitations. The BOD5 limitation is determined by the addition of the net BOD5 attributable to the barometric condenser cooling water to that amount of BOD5 attributable to the treated process waste water. The TSS limitation is that amount of TSS attributable to the treated process waste water, excluding barometric condenser cooling water.

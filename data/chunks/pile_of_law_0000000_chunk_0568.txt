atastrophic precipitation events cause the water level to rise into the surge capacity. Process wastewater must be treated and discharged whenever the water level equals or exceeds the mid point of the surge capacity.
              (c) The concentration of pollutants discharged in process wastewater pursuant to the limitations of paragraph (b) shall not exceed the values listed in the following table:
              
                
                  Effluent characteristic
                  Effluent limitations (mg/l)
                  Maximum for any 1 day
                  Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—
                
                
                  Total phosphorus (as P)
                  105

              The total suspended solid limitation set forth in this paragraph shall be waived for process wastewater from a calcium sulfate storage pile runoff facility, operated separately or in combination with a water recirculation system, which is chemically treated and then clarified or settled to meet the other pollutant limitations set forth in this paragraph.
              (d) The concentration of pollutants discharged in contaminated non-process wastewater shall not exceed the values listed in the following table:
              
                
                  Effluent characteristic
                  Effluent limitations (mg/l)
                  Maximum for any 1 day
                  Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—
                
                
                  Total phosphorus (as P)

              § 418.13
              Effluent limitations and guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attained by the application of the best available technology economically achievable.
              The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart after application of the best available technology economically achievable:
              (a) Subject to the provision of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart after application of the best available technology economically achievable: There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants to navigable waters.

              (b) Process wastewater pollutants from a calcium sulfate storage pile runoff facility operated separately or in combination with a water recirculation system designed, constructed and operated to maintain a surge capacity equal to the runoff from the 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event may be discharged, after treatment to the standards set forth in paragraph

              § 414.80
              Applicability; description of the specialty organic chemicals subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to the process wastewater discharges resulting from the manufacture of all SIC 2865 and 2869 organic chemicals and organic chemical groups which are not defined as commodity or bulk organic chemicals in §§ 414.60 and 414.70, respectively.

              Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, and in 40 CFR 414.11(i) for point sources with production in two or more subcategories, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve discharges not exceeding the quantity (mass) determined by multiplying the process wastewater flow subject to this subpart times the concentration listed in the following table.

              § 414.82
              Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best conventional pollutant control technology (BCT). [Reserved]
            
            
              § 414.83
              Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT).
              (a) The Agency has determined that for existing point sources whose total OCPSF production defined by § 414.11 is less than or equal to five (5) million pounds of OCPSF products per year, the BPT level of treatment is the best available technology economically achievable. Accordingly, the Agency is not promulgating more stringent BAT limitations for these point sources.
              (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section and in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source that uses end-of-pipe biological treatment and is subject to this subpart must achieve discharges in accordance with § 414.91 of this part.

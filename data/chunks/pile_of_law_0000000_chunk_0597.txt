              (d) The following allocations constitute the quantity and quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this paragraph, attributable to ballast, which may be discharged after the application of best available technology economically achievable by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart. These allocations are in addition to the discharge allowed by paragraph (b) of this section. The allocation allowed for ballast water flow, as kg/cu m (lb/M gal), shall be based on those ballast waters treated at the refinery.

                If in the judgment of the Regional Administrator, adequate correlation data are not available, the effluent limitations for TOC shall be established at a ratio of 2.2 to 1 to the applicable effluent limitations on BOD5.
                
              

              (e) The quantity and quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this paragraph, attributable to once-through cooling water, are excluded from the discharge allowed by paragraph (b) of this section. Once-through cooling water may be discharged with a total organic carbon concentration not to exceed 5 mg/l.
              (f) Effluent limitations for contaminated runoff. The following effluent limitations constitute the quantity and quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this paragraph and attributable to contaminated runoff, which may be discharged after the application of the best available technology economically achievable by a point source subject to this subpart.
              (1) If wastewater consists solely of contaminated runoff and is not c

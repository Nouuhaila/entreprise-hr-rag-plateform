              Specialized definitions.
              For the purpose of this subpart:
              (a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations and methods of analysis set forth in part 401 of this chapter shall apply to this subpart.
              (b) Net shall mean the addition of pollutants.
              (c) Melt shall mean that amount of raw material (raw sugar) contained within aqueous solution at the beginning of the process for production of refined cane sugar.
            
            
              § 409.22
              Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.
              Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

              (a) Any crystalline cane sugar refinery discharging both barometric condenser cooling water and other process waters shall meet the following limitations. The BOD5 limitation is determined by the addition of the net BOD5 attributed to the barometric condenser cooling water to that amount of BOD5 attributed to the treated process water. The TSS limitation is that amount of TSS attributed to the treated process water. Where the barometric condenser cooling water and process water streams are mixed and impossible to measure separately prior to discharge, the values should be considered net.

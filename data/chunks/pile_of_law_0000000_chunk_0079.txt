detention period should be based on a 24-hour average daily flow value. The average daily flow should in turn be based upon the average of the daily flows during the same month of the previous year. Grab sampling should be employed where the pollutants being evaluated are those, such as cyanide and phenol, which may not be held for an extended period because of biological, chemical or physical interaction which take place after sample collection and affect the results.

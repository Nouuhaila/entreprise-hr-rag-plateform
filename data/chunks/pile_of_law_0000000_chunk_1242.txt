              Applicability; description of the covered calcium carbide furnaces with wet air pollution control devices subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the production of calcium carbide in covered electric furnaces which use wet air pollution control devices. This subcategory includes those electric furnaces of such construction or configuration (known as covered, closed, sealed, semi-covered or semi-closed furnaces) that the furnace off-gases are not burned prior to collection and cleaning, and which off-gases are cleaned after collection in a wet air pollution control device such as a scrubber, ‘;wet’ baghouse, etc. This subcategory does not include noncontact cooling water or those furnaces which utilize dry dust collection techniques, such as dry baghouses.

            Subpart D—Woven Fabric Finishing Subcategory
            
              § 410.40
              Applicability; description of the woven fabric finishing subcategory.

              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to process wastewater discharges resulting from the following types of textile mills: woven fabric finishers, which may include any or all of the following unit operations: Desizing, bleaching, mercerizing, dyeing, printing, resin treatment, water proofing, flame proofing, soil repellency application and a special finish application.
            
            
              § 410.41
              Specialized definitions.

              (a) The term simple manufacturing operation shall mean all the following unit processes: Desizing, fiber preparation and dyeing.
              (b) The term complex manufacturing operation shall mean “simple” unit processes (desizing, fiber preparation and dyeing) plus any additional manufacturing operations such as printing, water proofing, or applying stain resistance or other functional fabric finishes.
              (c) For NSPS (§ 410.45) the term desizing facilities shall mean those facilities that desize more than 50 percent of their total production. These facilities may also perform other processing such as fiber preparation, scouring, mercerizing, functional finishing, bleaching, dyeing and printing.
            
            
              § 410.42

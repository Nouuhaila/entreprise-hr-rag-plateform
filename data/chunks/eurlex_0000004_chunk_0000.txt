COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1116/97 of 19 June 1997 on the sale by tender of beef held by certain intervention agencies and intended for processing within the Community
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2222/96 (2), and in particular Article 7 (3) thereof,
Whereas the application of intervention measures in respect of beef has created stocks in several Member States; whereas, in order to prevent an excessive prolongation of storage, part of these stocks should be sold by tender with a view to being processed within the Community;
Whereas in the light of the prevailing market circumstances it is appropriate to restrict the list of the eligible finished products to such products which besides beef also contain pork provided that the proportion of pork vis-à-vis beef is significantly reduced;
Whereas the sale should be made subject to the rules laid down by Commission Regulations (EEC) No 2173/79 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2417/95 (4), (EEC) No 3002/92 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 770/96 (6) and (EEC) No 2182/77 (7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2417/95, subject to certain special exceptions on account of the particular use to which the products in question are to be put;
Whereas with a view to securing a regular and uniform tendering procedure, measures should be taken in addition to those laid down in Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2173/79; whereas these measures must be applied as quickly as possible;
Whereas it seems appropriate to provide for derogations from provisions of Article 8 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2173/79, taking into account the administrative difficulties which the application of this subparagraph raises in the Member States concerned;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

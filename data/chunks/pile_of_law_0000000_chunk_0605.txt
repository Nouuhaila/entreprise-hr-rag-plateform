              Pretreatment standards for new sources (PSNS).
              Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7, any new source subject to this subpart which introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and achieve the following pretreatment standards for new sources (PSNS).
              (a) The following standards apply to the total refinery flow contribution to the POTW:
              
                
                  Pollutant or pollutant property

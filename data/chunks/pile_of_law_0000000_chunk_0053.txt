ment Standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with § 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the Control Authority;

            (v) Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the Administrator determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the Administrator;
            (vi) The Control Authority may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
            (vii) The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant Discharges to the POTW;
            (6) Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the Industrial User (as defined in paragraph (l) of this section) and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether Pretreatment Standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O and M) and/or additional Pretreatment is required for the Industrial User to meet the Pretreatment Standards and Requirements; and
            (7) Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O and M will be required to meet the Pretreatment Standards; the shortest schedule by which the Industrial User will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O and M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable Pretreatment Standard.
            (i) Where the Industrial User's categorical Pretreatment Standard has been modified by a removal allowance (§ 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (§ 403.6(e)), and/or a Fundamentally Different Factors variance (§ 403.13) at the time the User submits the report required by paragraph (b) of this section, the information required by paragraphs (b)(6) and (7) of this section shall pertain to the modified limits.
            (ii) If the categorical Pretreatment Standard is modified by a removal allowance (§ 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (§ 403.6(e)), and/or a Fundamentally Different Factors variance (§ 403.13) after the User submits the report required by paragraph (b) of this section, any necessary amendments to the information requested by paragraphs (b)(6) and (7) of this section shall be submitted by the User to the Control Authority within 60 days after the modified limit is approved.
            (c) Compliance schedule for meeting categorical Pretreatment Standards. The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by paragraph (b)(7) of this section:
            (1) The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the Indust

              (b) The limitations given in paragraph (a) of this section for BOD5 and TSS are derived for a point source producing products standard to the corn wet milling industry. For those plants producing modified starches at a rate of at least 15 percent by dry-basis weight of total sweetener and starch products per month for 12 consecutive months, the following limitations should be used to derive an additive adjustment to the discharge allowed by paragraph (a) of this section:

              § 406.20
              Applicability; description of the corn dry milling subcategory.
              (a) The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the process in which shelled corn is washed and subsequently milled by dry processes into such products as corn meal, grits, flour, oil, and animal feed.
              (b) The provisions of this subpart do not apply to discharges from subsequent manufacturing operations to produce expanded or extruded feed or feed products.

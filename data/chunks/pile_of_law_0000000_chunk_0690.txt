              § 420.40
              Applicability; description of the steelmaking subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges and to the introduction of pollutants into publicly owned treatment works resulting from steelmaking operations conducted in basic oxygen and electric arc furnaces.

              § 420.41
              Specialized definitions.
              (a) The term basic oxygen furnace steelmaking means the production of steel from molten iron, steel scrap, fluxes, and various combinations thereof, in refractory lined furnaces by adding oxygen.
              (b) [Reserved]
              (c) The term electric arc furnace steelmaking means the production of steel principally from steel scrap and fluxes in refractory lined furnaces by passing an electric current through the scrap or steel bath.
              (d) The term wet means those steelmaking air cleaning systems that primarily use water for furnace gas cleaning.
              (e) The term semi-wet means those steelmaking air cleaning systems that use water for the sole purpose of conditioning the temperature and humidity of furnace gases such that the gases may be cleaned in dry air pollution control systems.
              (f) The term open combustion means those basic oxygen furnace steelmaking wet air cleaning systems which are designed to allow excess air to enter the air pollution control system for the purpose of combusting the carbon monoxide in furnace gases.
              (g) The term suppressed combustion means those basic oxygen furnace steelmaking wet air cleaning systems which are designed to limit or suppress the combustion of carbon monoxide in furnace gases by restricting the amount of excess air entering the air pollution control system.

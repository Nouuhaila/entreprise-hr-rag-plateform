            Subpart D—Glycerine Concentration Subcategory
            
              § 417.40
              Applicability; description of the glycerine concentration subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the concentration of sweet water from saponification or fat splitting to approximately 60 to 80 percent crude glycerine content.
            
            
              § 417.41

              For the purpose of this subpart:
              (a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations and methods of analysis set forth in 40 CFR part 401 shall apply to this subpart.
              (b) The term anhydrous product shall mean the theoretical product that would result if all water were removed from the actual product.
              (c) The term sweet water shall mean the solution of 8-10 percent crude glycerine and 90-22 percent water that is a by-product of saponification or fat splitting.

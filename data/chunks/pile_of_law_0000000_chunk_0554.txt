              § 417.170
              Applicability; description of the manufacture of detergents by dry blending subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the operations associated with the manufacture of detergents by means of the blending of dry ingredients, including, but not limited to, blending and subsequent packaging.
            
            
              § 417.171
              Specialized definitions.
              For the purpose of this subpart:
              (a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations and methods of analysis set forth in 40 CFR part 401 shall apply to this subpart.
              (b) The term anhydrous product shall mean the theoretical product that would result if all water were removed from the actual product.
              (c) The term surfactant shall mean those methylene blue active substances amenable to measurement by the method described in “Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes,” 1971, Environmental Protection Agency, Analytical Quality Control Laboratory, page 131.
              
              (d) The term BOD7 shall mean the biochemical oxygen demand as determined by incubation at 20 degrees C for a period of 7 days using an acclimated seed. Agitation employing a magnetic stirrer set at 200 to 500 rpm may be used.

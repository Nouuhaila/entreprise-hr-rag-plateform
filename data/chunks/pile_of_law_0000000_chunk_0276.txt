fluent reduction attainable by the application of the best conventional pollutant control technology (BCT): The limitations shall be the same as those specified for conventional pollutants (which are defined in § 401.16) in § 409.32 of this subpart for the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT).

              Applicability; description of the Louisiana raw cane sugar processing subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the processing of sugar cane into a raw sugar product for those cane sugar factories operating in the State of Louisiana.

              Specialized definitions.
              For the purpose of this subpart:
              (a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations and methods of analysis set forth in 40 CFR part 401 shall apply to this subpart.
              (b) The term gross cane shall mean that amount of crop material as harvested, including field trash and other extraneous material.
            
            
              § 409.42
              Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.
              Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

              (a) Any cane sugar factory continuously discharging both barometric condenser cooling water and other process waste waters shall meet the following limitations. The BOD5 limitation is determined by the addition of the net BOD5 attributable to the barometric condenser cooling water to that amount of BOD5 attributable to the treated process waste water. The TSS limitation is that amount of TSS attributable to the treated process waste water, excluding barometric condenser cooling water.

d methods of analysis set forth in 40 CFR part 401 shall apply to this subpart.
              (b) The term product shall mean nitric acid on the basis of 100 percent HNO3.
              (c) The term shipping losses shall mean: Discharges resulting from loading tank cars or tank trucks; discharges resulting from cleaning tank cars or tank trucks; and discharges from air pollution control scrubbers designed to control emissions from loading or cleaning tank cars or tank trucks.
              (d) The term shipped liquid ammonia shall mean liquid ammonia commercially shipped for which the Department of Transportation requires 0.2 percent minimum water content.
              (e) The term non-contact cooling water shall mean water which is used in a cooling system designed so as to maintain constant separation of the cooling medium from all contact with process chemicals but which may on the occasion of corrosion, cooling system leakage or similar cooling system failures contain small amounts of process chemicals: Provided, That all reasonable measures have been taken to prevent, reduce, eliminate and control to the maximum extent feasible such contamination: And provided further, That all reasonable measures have been taken that will mitigate the effects of such contamination once it has occurred.

              Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.
              Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):
              (a) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants which may be discharged in process waste water from nitric acid production in which all the raw material ammonia is in the gaseous form:
              
                [Metric units, kg/kkg of product; English units, lb/1,000 lb of product]
                
                  Effluent characteristic
                  Effluent limitations
                  Maximum for any 1 day
                  Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—
                
                
                  Ammonia (as N)

              (b) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants which may be discharged in process waste water from nitric acid production in which all the raw material ammonia is in the shipped liquid form:
              
                [Metric units, kg/kkg of product; English units, lb/1,000 lb of product]
                
                  Effluent characteristic
                  Effluent limitations
                  Maximum for any 1 day
                  Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—
                
                
                  Ammonia (as N)

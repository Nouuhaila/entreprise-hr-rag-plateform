              § 420.113
              Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT).

              The Agency has determined that there are not significant quantities of toxic pollutants in alkaline cleaning wastewaters after compliance with applicable BPT limitations. Accordingly, since the BPT level of treatment provides adequate control, the Agency is not promulgating more stringent BAT limitations.
            
            
              § 420.114

              The discharge of wastewater pollutants from any new source subject to this subpart shall not exceed the standards set forth below.
              (a) Batch and continuous.

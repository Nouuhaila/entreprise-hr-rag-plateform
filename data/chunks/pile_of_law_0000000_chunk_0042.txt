mmediately of any changes at its facility affecting potential for a Slug Discharge. If the POTW decides that a slug control plan is needed, the plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following elements:

            (A) Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch Discharges;
            
            (B) Description of stored chemicals;
            (C) Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of Slug Discharges, including any Discharge that would violate a prohibition under § 403.5(b) with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days;
            (D) If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response;
            (vii) Investigate instances of noncompliance with Pretreatment Standards and Requirements, as indicated in the reports and notices required under § 403.12, or indicated by analysis, inspection, and surveillance activities described in paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section. Sample taking and analysis and the collection of other information shall be performed with sufficient care to produce evidence admissible in enforcement proceedings or in judicial actions; and
            (viii) Comply with the public participation requirements of 40 CFR part 25 in the enforcement of National Pretreatment Standards. These procedures shall include provision for at least annual public notification in a newspaper(s) of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW of Industrial Users which, at any time during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable Pretreatment requirements. For the purposes of this provision, a Significant Industrial User (or any Industrial User which violates paragraphs (f)(2)(viii)(C), (D), or (H) of this section) is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the following criteria:
            (A) Chronic violations of wastewater Discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a 6-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l);
            (B) Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a 6-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l) multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
            (C) Any other violation of a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l) (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative Standard) that the POTW determines has caused, alone or in combination with other Discharges, Interference or Pass Through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public);
            (D) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused im

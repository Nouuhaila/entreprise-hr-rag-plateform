              Pretreatment standards for existing sources.
              Any existing source subject to this subpart that introduces process wastewater pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403. In addition, the following pretreatment standard establishes the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this section which may be discharged to a publicly owned treatment works by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart.

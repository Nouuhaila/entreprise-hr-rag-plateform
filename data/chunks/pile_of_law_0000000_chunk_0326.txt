              Applicability.
              This subpart applies to discharges resulting from the production areas at dry lot and wet lot duck CAFOs. This subpart does not apply to such CAFOs with less than the following capacities: 5,000 ducks.
            
            
              § 412.21
              Special definitions.
              For the purposes of this subpart:
              (a) Dry lot means a facility for growing ducks in confinement with a dry litter floor cover and no access to swimming areas.
              (b) Wet lot means a confinement facility for raising ducks which is open to the environment, has a small number of sheltered areas, and with open water runs and swimming areas to which ducks have free access.

(a) Any liquid cane sugar refinery discharging both barometric condenser cooling water and other process waters shall meet the following limitations. The BOD5 limitation is determined by the addition of the net BOD5 attributed to the barometric condenser cooling water to that amount of BOD5 attributed to the treated process water. The TSS limitation is that amount of TSS attributed to the treated process water. Where the barometric condenser cooling water and process water streams are mixed and impossible to measure separately prior to discharge, the values should be considered net.

              Any existing source subject to this subpart that introduces process wastewater pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403. In addition, the following pretreatment standard establishes the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this section which may be discharged to a publicly owned treatment works by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart.

            Subpart B—Fatty Acid Manufacturing by Fat Splitting Subcategory
            
              § 417.20
              Applicability; description of the fatty acid manufacturing by fat splitting subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the splitting of fats to fatty acids by hydrolysis and the subsequent processing of the fatty acids (e.g., refining and hydrogenation) to produce a suitable feed material for manufacture of soap by fatty acid neutralization.
            
            
              § 417.21
              Specialized definitions.
              For the purpose of this subpart:
              (a) Except as provided below, the general definitions, abbreviations and methods of analysis set forth in 40 CFR part 401 shall apply to this subpart.
              (b) The term anhydrous product shall mean the theoretical product that would result if all water were removed from the actual product.
            
            
              § 417.22
              Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.

              Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):
              
              (a) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart after application of the best practicable control technology currently available:
              
                
                  Effluent characteristic
                  Effluent limitations
                  Maximum for any 1 day
                  Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—

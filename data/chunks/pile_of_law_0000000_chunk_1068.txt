              Applicability: Description of the primary rare earth metals subcategory.
              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the production of rare earth metals and mischmetal by primary rare earth metals facilities processing rare earth metal oxides, chlorides, and fluorides.
            
            
              § 421.271
              Specialized definitions.

              (b) The term rare earth metals refers to the elements scandium, yttrium, and lanthanum to lutetium, inclusive.
              (c) The term mischmetal refers to a rare earth metal alloy comprised of the natural mixture of rare earths to about 94-99 percent. The balance of tha alloy includes traces of other elements and one to two percent iron.

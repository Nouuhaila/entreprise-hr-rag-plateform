ection limit. An alternative pretreatment limit may not be used if the alternative limit is below the analytical detection limit for any of the regulated pollutants.
            (3) Self-monitoring. Self-monitoring required to insure compliance with the alternative categorical limit shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of § 403.12(g).
            (4) Choice of monitoring location. Where a treated regulated process wastestream is combined prior to treatment with wastewaters other than those generated by the regulated process, the Industrial User may monitor either the segregated process wastestream or the combined wastestream for the purpose of determining compliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards. If the Industrial User chooses to monitor the segregated process wastestream, it shall apply the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard. If the User chooses to monitor the combined wastestream, it shall apply an alternative discharge limit calculated using the combined wastestream formula as provided in this section. The Industrial User may change monitoring points only after receiving approval from the Control Authority. The Control Authority shall ensure that any change in an Industrial User's monitoring point(s) will not allow the User to substitute dilution for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with applicable Standards.

            § 403.7
            Removal credits.
            (a) Introduction—(1) Definitions. For the purpose of this section:
            (i) Removal means a reduction in the amount of a pollutant in the POTW's effluent or alteration of the nature of a pollutant during treatment at the POTW. The reduction or alteration can be obtained by physical, chemical or biological means and may be the result of specifically designed POTW capabilities or may be incidental to the operation of the treatment system. Removal as used in this subpart shall not mean dilution of a pollutant in the POTW.
            (ii) Sludge requirements shall mean the following statutory provisions and regulations or permits issued thereunder (or more stringent State or local regulations): Section 405 of the Clean Water Act; the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) (including title II more commonly referred to as the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) and State regulations contained in any State sludge management plan prepared pursuant to subtitle D of SWDA); the Clean Air Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; and the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act.
            (2) General. Any POTW receiving wastes from an Industrial User to which a categorical Pretreatment Standard(s) applies may, at its discretion and subject to the conditions of this section, grant removal credits to reflect removal by the POTW of pollutants specified in the categorical Pretreatment Standard(s). The POTW may grant a removal credit equal to or, at its discretion, less than its consistent removal rate. Upon being granted a removal credit, each affected Industrial User shall calculate its revised discharge limits in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Removal credits may only be given for indicator or surrogate pollutants reg

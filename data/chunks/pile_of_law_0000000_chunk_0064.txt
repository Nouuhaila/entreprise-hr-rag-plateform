n requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12 (b), (d), and (e).
            (2) Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (p)(1) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification.
            Subsequent months during which the Industrial User discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
            (3) In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the Industrial User must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.

            (4) In the case of any notification made under paragraph (p) of this section, the Industrial User shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.

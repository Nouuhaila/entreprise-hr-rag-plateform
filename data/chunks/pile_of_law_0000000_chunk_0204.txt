              Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best conventional pollutant control technology (BCT): The limitations shall be the same as those specified for conventional pollutants (which are defined in § 401.16) in § 408.102 of this subpart for the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT).

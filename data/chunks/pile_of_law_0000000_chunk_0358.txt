              (a) No user introducing wastewater pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works under the provisions of this subpart shall augment the use of process wastewater or otherwise dilute the wastewater as a partial or total substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with this standard.
              (b) For a source discharging less than 38,000 liters (10,000 gal) per calendar day of electroplating process wastewater the following limitations shall apply:

              Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable.
              (a) Electric arc furnace steelmaking—semi-wet. No discharge of process wastewater pollutants to navigable waters.
              (b) Basic oxygen furnace steelmaking—wet-suppressed combustion.

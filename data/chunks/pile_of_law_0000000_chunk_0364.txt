ng activities at the plant site.
              (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the provisions of this part are not applicable to discharges resulting from the manufacture of OCPSF products if the products are included in the following SIC subgroups and have in the past been reported by the establishment under these subgroups and not under the SIC groups listed in paragraph (a) of this section:
              (1) SIC 2843085—bulk surface active agents;
              (2) SIC 28914—synthetic resin and rubber adhesives;
              (3) Chemicals and Chemical Preparations, not Elsewhere Classified:
              (i) SIC 2899568—sizes, all types

              (ii) SIC 2899597—other industrial chemical specialties, including fluxes, plastic wood preparations, and embalming fluids;
              (4) SIC 2911058—aromatic hydrocarbons manufactured from purchased refinery products; and
              (5) SIC 2911632—aliphatic hydrocarbons manufactured from purchased refinery products.
              (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the provisions of this part are not applicable to any discharges for which a different set of previously promulgated effluent limitations guidelines and standards in this subchapter apply, unless the facility reports OCPSF products under SIC codes 2865, 2869, or 2821, and the facility's OCPSF wastewaters are treated in a separate treatment system or discharged separately to a publicly owned treatment works.
              (e) The provisions of this part do not apply to any process wastewater discharges from the manufacture of organic chemical compounds solely by extraction from plant and animal raw materials or by fermentation processes.
              (f) Discharges of chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc in “complexed metal-bearing waste streams,” listed in appendix B of this part, are not subject to the requirements of this part.
              (g) Non-amenable cyanide. Discharges of cyanide in “cyanide-bearing waste streams” (listed in appendix A to this part) are not subject to the cyanide limitations and standards of this part if the permit writer or control authority determines that the cyanide limitations and standards are not achievable due to elevated levels of non-amenable cyanide (i.e., cyanide that is not oxidized by chlorine treatment) that result from the unavoidable complexing of cyanide at the process source of the cyanide-bearing waste stream and establishes an alternative total cyanide or amenable cyanide limitation that reflects the best available technology economically achievable. The determination must be based upon a review of relevant engineering, production, and sampling and analysis information, including measurements of both total and amenable cyanide in the waste stream. An analysis of the extent of complexing in the waste stream, based on the foregoing information, and its impact on cyanide treatability shall be set forth in writing and, for direct dischargers, be contained in the fact sheet required by 40 CFR 124.8.
              (h) Allowances for non-metal-bearing waste streams. Discharge limitations for chromium, copper, lead, nickel, and zinc or discharge standards for lead and zinc may be established for waste streams not listed in appendix A of this part and not otherwise determined to be “metal-bearing waste streams” if the permit writer or control authority determines that the wastewater metals contamination is due to background levels that are

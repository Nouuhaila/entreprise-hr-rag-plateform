              (a) Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart and using the solar evaporation process must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT): There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants to navigable waters, except that unused bitterns may be returned to the body of water from which the process brine solution was originally withdrawn, provided no additional pollutants are added to the bitterns during the production of sodium chloride.

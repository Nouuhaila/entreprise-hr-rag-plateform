                  1 In any case in which the applicant can demonstrate that the chloride ion concentration in the effluent exceeds 1,000 mg/l (1,000 ppm), the permitting authority may substitute TOC as a parameter in lieu of COD. A TOC effluent limitation shall be based on effluent data from the particular refinery which correlates TOC to BOD5. If in the judgment of the permitting authority, adequate correlation data are not available, the effluent limitations for TOC shall be established at a ratio of 2.2 to 1 to the applicable effluent limitations for BOD5.

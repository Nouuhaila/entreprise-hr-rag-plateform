              Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable.
              (a) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties which may be discharged by a point source where the sugar beet processing capacity of the point source does not exceed 1090 kkg (2300 tons) per day of beets sliced or where the soil filtration rate, whether natural or by deliberate design, within the boundaries of all waste water treatment or retention facilities associated with the point source is less than or equal to 0.159 cm (1/16 in.) per day; provided however, that a discharge by a point source may be made in accordance with the limitations set forth in either paragraph (a)(1) exclusively, or paragraph (a)(2) of this section exclusively.
              (1) The following limitations establish the maximum permissible discharge of process waste water pollutants when the process waste water discharge results from barometric condensing operations only.

              (2) The following limitations establish the maximum permissible discharge of process waste water pollutants when the process waste water discharge results, in whole or in part, from barometric condensing operations and any other beet sugar processing operation.

              Pretreatment standards for existing sources.
              Any existing source subject to this subpart that introduces process wastewater pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403. In addition, the following pretreatment standard establishes the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this section which may be discharged to a publicly owned treatment works by a

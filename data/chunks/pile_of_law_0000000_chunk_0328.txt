it, the CAFO owner or operator must submit a supporting technical analysis and any other relevant information and data that would support such site-specific effluent limitations within the time frame provided by the Director. The supporting technical analysis must include calculation of the quantity of pollutants discharged, on a mass basis where appropriate, based on a site-specific analysis of a system designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to contain all manure, litter, and process wastewater, including the runoff from a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event. The technical analysis of the discharge of pollutants must include:
              (A) All daily inputs to the storage system, including manure, litter, all process waste waters, direct precipitation, and runoff.
              (B) All daily outputs from the storage system, including losses due to evaporation, sludge removal, and the removal of waste water for use on cropland at the CAFO or transport off site.
              (C) A calculation determining the predicted median annual overflow volume based on a 25-year period of actual rainfall data applicable to the site.
              (D) Site-specific pollutant data, including N, P, BOD5, TSS, for the CAFO from representative sampling and analysis of all sources of input to the storage system, or other appropriate pollutant data.
              (E) Predicted annual average discharge of pollutants, expressed where appropriate as a mass discharge on a daily basis (lbs/day), and calculated considering paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A) through (a)(2)(i)(D) of this section.
              (ii) The Director has the discretion to request additional information to supplement the supporting technical analysis, including inspection of the CAFO.
              (3) The CAFO shall attain the limitations and requirements of this paragraph as of the date of permit coverage.
              (b) For CAFO land application areas. Discharges from land application areas are subject to the following requirements:
              (1) Develop and implement the best management practices specified in § 412.4;
              (2) Maintain the records specified at § 412.37 (c);
              (3) The CAFO shall attain the limitations and requirements of this paragraph by February 27, 2009.

              § 412.32
              Effluent limitations attainable by the application of the best conventional pollutant control technology (BCT).
              Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the application of BCT:
              (a) For CAFO production areas: the CAFO shall attain the same limitations and requirements as § 412.31(a).
              (b) For CAFO land application areas: the CAFO shall attain the same limitations and requirements as § 412.31(b).
            
            
              § 412.33
              Effluent limitations attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT).
              Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the application of BAT:
              (a) For CAFO production areas: the CAFO shall attain the same limitations and req

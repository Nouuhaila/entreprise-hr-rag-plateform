greater quantities of waste water than can be recycled to process.
              (f) The term fast turnaround operation of a spray drying tower shall mean operation involving more than 6 changes of formulation in a 30 consecutive day period that are of such degree and type (e.g., high phosphate to no phosphate) as to require cleaning of the tower to maintain minimal product quality.
              (g) The term BOD7 shall mean the biochemical oxygen demand as determined by incubation at 20 degrees C for a period of 7 days using an acclimated seed. Agitation employing a magnetic stirrer set at 200 to 500 rpm may be used.

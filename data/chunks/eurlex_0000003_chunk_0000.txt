COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1281/94 of 2 June 1994 establishing a system for the surveillance of imports of fresh sour cherries originating in the Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia and the territory of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3698/93 of 22 December 1993 concerning the arrangements applicable to the import into the Community of products originating in the Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia and the territory of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (1), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
Whereas Regulation (EC) No 3698/93 provides for the grant of tariff concessions for fresh sour cherries originating in the Republics referred to above within the limit of an annual ceiling of 3 000 tonnes; whereas, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (2), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 882/94 (3), chilled cherries are to be classified under the same tariff heading as fresh cherries;
Whereas, in order to ensure that these provisions are properly applied, imports of fresh sour cherries originating in the Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia and the territory of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be subject to a system of import licences; whereas the special rules governing that system should be laid down;
Whereas exceptions to certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3519/93 (5), should be made to avoid exceeding the quantity fixed in Regulation (EC) No 3698/93;
Whereas import licences are issued using the most detailed CN code; whereas the combined nomenclature comprises two codes according to the periods of importation of sour cherries; whereas provision should accordingly be made for the issue of import licences for the two CN codes concerned; whereas, moreover, the period of validity of licences take into account the time for transporting the product to the Community;
Whereas, in order to ensure the proper operation of this system, provision should be made for weekly notification by the Member States of the quantities relating to unused or partly unused licences,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

              Pretreatment standards for new sources.
              Any new source subject to this subpart that introduces process wastewater pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403. In addition, the following pretreatment standards establishes the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, which may be discharged to a publicly owned treatment works by a new source subject to the provisions of this subpart.

              (a) There shall be no discharge of waste water streams in which both the COD/BOD7 ratio exceeds 10.0 and the COD exceeds 2.4 kg/kkg of anhydrous product.

              (b) For waste streams having either a ratio of COD to BOD7 of 10.0 or less or having a COD content of 2.40 kg/kkg of anhydrous product or less the pretreatment standard shall be:

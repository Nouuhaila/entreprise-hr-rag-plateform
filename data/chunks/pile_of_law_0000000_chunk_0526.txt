              Applicability; description of the SO3 solvent and vacuum sulfonation subcategory.

              The provisions of this subpart are applicable to discharges resulting from the operations in which undiluted SO3 and organic reactant are fed through a mixing nozzle into a vacuum reactor where the sulfonation of the organic reactant takes place.

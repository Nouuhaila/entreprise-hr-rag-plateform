              § 419.57
              Pretreatment standards for new sources (PSNS).
              Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7, any new source subject to this subpart which introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and achieve the following pretreatment standards for new sources (PSNS).
              (a) The following standards apply to the total refinery flow contribution to the POTW:
              
                
                  Pollutant or pollutant property
                  Pretreatment standards for new sources—maximum for any 1 day
                
                
                  
                  Milligrams per liter (mg/l)

                  1 Where the discharge to the POTW consists solely of sour waters, the owner or operator has the option of complying with this limit or the daily maximum mass limitation for ammonia set forth in § 419.56 (a) and (b).
              
              (b) The following standard is applied to the cooling tower discharge part of the total refinery flow to the POTW by multiplying: (1) The standards; (2) by the total refinery flow to the POTW; and (3) by the ratio of the cooling tower discharge flow to the total refinery flow.

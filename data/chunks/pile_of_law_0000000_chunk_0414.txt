              Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT):
              (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section there shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants into navigable waters.

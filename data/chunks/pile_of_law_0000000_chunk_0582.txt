              Pretreatment standards for new sources.
              The pretreatment standards under section 307(c) of the Act for a source within the nitric acid subcategory, which is a user of a publicly owned treatment works (and which would be a new source subject to section 306 of the Act, if it were to discharge pollutants to the navigable waters), shall be the standard set forth in part 128 of this chapter, except that, for the purpose of this section, § 128.133 of this chapter shall be amended to read as follows: In addition to the prohibitions set forth in § 128.131 of this chapter, the following pretreatment standard establishes the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this section which may be discharged to publicly owned treatment works by a new source subject to the provisions of this subpart:
              (a) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants which may be discharged in process waste water from nitric acid production in which all the raw material ammonia is in the gaseous form:
              
                [Metric units, kg/kkg of product; English units, lb/1,000 lb of product]

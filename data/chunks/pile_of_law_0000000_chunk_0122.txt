Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.

              (a) Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, and subject to the provisions in paragraph (b) of this section, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):
              
                
                  Effluent characteristic
                  Effluent limitations
                  Maximum for any 1 day
                  Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—

              (b) The limitations given in paragraph (a) of this section for BOD5 and TSS are derived for a point source producing products standards to the corn wet milling industry. For those plants producing modified starches at a rate of at least 15 percent by dry-basis weight of total sweetener and starch products per month for 12 consecutive months, the following limitations should be used to derive an additive adjustment to the discharge allowed by paragraph (a) of this section:
              
                
                  Effluent characteristic
                  Effluent limitations
                  Maximum for any 1 day
                  Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—
                
                
                  
                  Metric units (kilograms per 1,000 kg of corn)

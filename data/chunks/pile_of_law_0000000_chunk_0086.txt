in part 401 of this chapter shall apply to this subpart.
              (b) The term “BOD5 input” shall mean the biochemical oxygen demand of the materials entered into process. It can be calculated by multiplying the fats, proteins and carbohydrates by factors of 0.890, 1.031 and 0.691 respectively. Organic acids (e.g., lactic acids) should be included as carbohydrates. Composition of input materials may be based on either direct analyses or generally accepted published values.
            
            
              § 405.12
              Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.
              Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

              (a) For receiving stations receiving more than 150,000 lb/day of milk equivalent (15,600 lb/day or more of BOD5 input).

                Notes:
                See table § 419.42(b)(2) for process factor. Process factor = 0.88.
                See table § 419.42(b)(1) for size factor for 125,000 bbl per stream day lube refinery. Size factor = 0.97.
                To calculate the limits for each parameter, multiply the limit § 419.42(a) by both the process factor and size factor. BOD5 limit (maximum for any 1 day) = 17.9 × 0.88 × 0.97 = 15.3 lb. per 1,000 bbl of feedstock.
              
              (c) The provisions of § 419.12(c) apply to discharges of process wastewater pollutants attributable to ballast water by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart.
              (d) The quantity and quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this paragraph, attributable to once-through cooling water, are excluded from the discharge allowed by paragraph (b) of this section. Once-through cooling water may be discharged with a total organic carbon concentration not to exceed 5 mg/l.
              (e) Effluent limitations for contaminated runoff. The following effluent limitations constitute the quantity and quality of pollutants

charge limits unless it shall first have notified the POTW and all Industrial Users to whom revised discharge limits have been applied, and made public, in writing, the reasons for such withdrawal or modification, and an opportunity is provided for a hearing. Following such notice and withdrawal or modification, all Industrial Users to whom revised discharge limits had been applied, shall be subject to the modified discharge limits or the discharge limits prescribed in the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standards, as appropriate, and shall achieve compliance with such limits within a reasonable time (not to exceed the period of time prescribed in the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard(s) as may be specified by the Approval Authority.
            
            (g) Removal credits in State-run pretreatment programs under § 403.10(e). Where an NPDES State with an approved pretreatment program elects to implement a local pretreatment program in lieu or requiring the POTW to develop such a program (as provided in § 403.10(e)), the POTW will not be required to develop a pretreatment program as a precondition to obtaining authorization to give removal credits. The POTW will, however, be required to comply with the other conditions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
            (h) Compensation for overflow. “Overflow” means the intentional or unintentional diversion of flow from the POTW before the POTW Treatment Plant. POTWs which at least once annually Overflow untreated wastewater to receiving waters may claim Consistent Removal of a pollutant only by complying with either paragraphs (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section. However, paragraph (h) of this section shall not apply where Industrial User(s) can demonstrate that Overflow does not occur between the Industrial User(s) and the POTW Treatment Plant;
            (1) The Industrial User provides containment or otherwise ceases or reduces Discharges from the regulated processes which contain the pollutant for which an allowance is requested during all circumstances in which an Overflow event can reasonably be expected to occur at the POTW or at a sewer to which the Industrial User is connected. Discharges must cease or be reduced, or pretreatment must be increased, to the extent necessary to compensate for the removal not being provided by the POTW. Allowances under this provision will only be granted where the POTW submits to the Approval Authority evidence that:
            (i) All Industrial Users to which the POTW proposes to apply this provision have demonstrated the ability to contain or otherwise cease or reduce, during circumstances in which an Overflow event can reasonably be expected to occur, Discharges from the regulated processes which contain pollutants for which an allowance is requested;
            (ii) The POTW has identified circumstances in which an Overflow event can reasonably be expected to occur, and has a notification or other viable plan to insure that Industrial Users will learn of an impending Overflow in sufficient time to contain, cease or reduce Discharging to prevent untreated Overflows from occurring. The POTW must also demonstrate that it will monitor and verify the data required in paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section, to insure that Industrial Users are containing, ceasing or reducing operations during POTW System Overflow; and
            (iii) All Industrial Users to which the POTW proposes to apply this provision have demonstrated the abi

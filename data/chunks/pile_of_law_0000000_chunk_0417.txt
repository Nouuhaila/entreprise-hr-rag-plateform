              § 415.52
              Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT).
              Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):
              (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, there shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants into navigable waters.
              (b) A process wastewater impoundment which is designed, constructed and operated so as to contain the precipitation from the 10-year, 24-hour rainfall event as established by the National Climatic Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for the area in which such impoundment is located may discharge that volume of process wastewater which is equivalent to the volume of precipitation that falls within the impoundment in excess of that attributable to the 10-year, 24-hour rainfall event, when such event occurs.
              (c) During any calendar month there may be discharged from a process wastewater impoundment either a volume of process wastewater equal to the difference between the precipitation for that month that falls within the impoundment and the evaporation for that month, or, if greater, a volume of process wastewater equal to the difference between the mean precipitation for that month that falls within the impoundment and the mean evaporation for that month as established by the National Climatic Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for the area in which such impoundment is located (or as otherwise determined if no monthly data have been established by the National Climatic Center).
              (d) Any process wastewater discharged pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section shall comply with each of the following requirements:
